WakaTime loves third party developers. We want to help make your project
awesome! That's why we've put together these assets which you can use in your
own projects, available for download at https://wakatime.com/logos.


DO THESE THINGS:

* Use the WakaTime name in the description of your project

* Use the WakaTime name or logo in your project if the primary purpose of your
  project is to promote the spread and improvement of the WakaTime software

* Use the WakaTime name or logo to link to WakaTime

* Use the WakaTIme logo to advertise that your product has built-in WakaTime
  integration

* Use the WakaTime logo in a blog post or news article about WakaTime


PLEASE DON'T DO THESE THINGS:

* Use the WakaTime name or logo in your project's name if the primary purpose of
  your project is not the spread and improvement of the WakaTime software

* Use the WakaTime name or logo in your project's name if your project
  duplicates functionality found in an existing WakaTime software

* Create a modified version of the WakaTime logo

* Integrate the WakaTime logo into your logo

* Use any WakaTime artwork without permission


For example, if you are building a plugin for an editor we don't yet support you
may call your plugin "xyz-wakatime". However, if you are creating a time
tracking plugin for Sublime Text please don't call it "WakaTime Timer" because
we already have an official WakaTime plugin for Sublime Text.
